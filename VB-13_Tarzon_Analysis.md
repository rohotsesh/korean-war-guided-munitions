# VB-13 Tarzon Guided Bomb Analysis

## Overview
The VB-13 Tarzon (also known as ASM-A-2) was a precision-guided bomb developed by the United States during the late 1940s and used in the Korean War. It was one of the first operational guided bombs, designed to destroy heavily fortified targets such as bridges, dams, and industrial facilities.

## Technical Specifications

| Diameter | 4 ft 6 in (1.37 m) |
| Warhead | 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) high-explosive |
| Guidance System | Radio‑command guidance (MCLOS – Manual Command to Line of Sight) |
| Control Surfaces | Cruciform tail fins with movable control surfaces |
| Propulsion | Unguided free‑fall bomb (no propulsion) |
| Launch Platform | B‑29 Superfortress (modified bomb bay) |

## Guidance System
- **Type**: Radio‑command guidance, operator‑controlled via a joystick in the bomber.
- **Operation**: The bombardier visually tracked the bomb through a periscopic sight and sent correction commands via radio link to movable tail fins.
- **Limitations**: Required continuous visual contact with the target; performance degraded in poor visibility (clouds, smoke, darkness). The manual control demanded high skill and concentration, and the radio link was susceptible to jamming or interference.

## Combat Usage
- **First Combat Deployment**: January 1951, Korean War.
- **Primary Targets**: Bridges over the Yalu River, hydroelectric dams, railway junctions, and other strategic infrastructure.
- **Notable Missions**: 
  - Attack on the Kanggye railway bridge (multiple attempts).
  - Strikes against the Sui‑ho Dam (April 1952).
- **Success Rate**: Modest; reported hits on several key bridges but many bombs missed due to guidance difficulties.

## Operational Limitations
1. **Weather Dependency**: Required clear line‑of‑sight between bombardier and bomb. Cloud cover, smoke, or haze often forced mission abort.
2. **Limited Stand‑off Range**: The bomber had to fly directly over or near the target, exposing it to anti‑aircraft artillery (AAA) and enemy fighters.
3. **Control Complexity**: The manual guidance demanded extensive training; even experienced bombardiers struggled to achieve consistent accuracy.
4. **Radio‑link Vulnerability**: The unsecured radio channel could be jammed or spoofed.
5. **Large Size and Weight**: The 12,000‑lb bomb required a modified B‑29 with reinforced bomb‑bay doors, limiting the number of aircraft that could carry it.

## Problems Leading to Withdrawal
- **High Cost vs. Effectiveness**: Each Tarzon bomb was expensive to produce, yet its hit probability remained low (estimated 10–20%).
- **Safety Issues**: Several accidents occurred during testing and combat, including premature detonations and guidance failures that endangered the launching aircraft.
- **Technological Obsolescence**: The manual radio‑command guidance was already being superseded by more autonomous systems (e.g., the ASM‑A‑1 Razon).
- **Operational Strain**: The need for a dedicated bombardier to guide the bomb throughout its flight limited the bomber’s ability to perform other tasks and increased crew fatigue.

## Historical Significance
The Tarzon represented an important step in the evolution of precision‑guided munitions. It demonstrated that large, unpowered bombs could be steered in flight, paving the way for later guided weapons such as the Razon and, eventually, laser‑ and GPS‑guided bombs. Its shortcomings highlighted the need for more automated, all‑weather guidance systems—a lesson that directly influenced the development of the ASM‑A‑1 Razon.
